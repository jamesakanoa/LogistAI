   python app.py
   

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the LogistAI demo interface.

3. Use the interface to test the demand forecasting, customer communication, and route optimization features.

## Models

LogistAI uses three main AI models:

1. Demand Forecasting Model: 
A Random Forest Regressor that predicts future demand based on historical sales, promotional effects, and economic indicators.

2. Customer Communication Model: 
A text classification model using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes to categorize customer inquiries.

3. Route Optimization Model: 
A Gradient Boosting Regressor that estimates delivery times based on distance, traffic density, and weather conditions.

For more details on how to use these models, refer to the User Guide.

API Reference

LogistAI provides a RESTful API for integration with other systems. Here are the main endpoints:

- `/predict/demand` (POST): Predict product demand
- `/predict/communication` (POST): Categorize customer messages
- `/predict/route` (POST): Estimate delivery times
