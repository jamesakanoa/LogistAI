## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/logistai/logistai/issues)
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/logistai/logistai/issues/new)
- Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most LogistAI users

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to LogistAI? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/logistai/logistai/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/logistai/logistai/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues

### Pull Requests

- Fill in the required template
- Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
- Follow the [Python Style Guide](#python-style-guide)
- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
- Document new code based on the [Documentation Style Guide](#documentation-style-guide)
- End all files with a newline

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Use docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions
- Keep line length to a maximum of 100 characters
- Use type hints for function arguments and return values

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for documentation
- Reference function and variable names using backticks: `like_this`
- Capitalize proper nouns and the word "I"
- Use active voice instead of passive voice
- Be clear and concise

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you
